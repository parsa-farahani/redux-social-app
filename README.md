# Asteroid - social app (showcase project)

  This is a simple and tiny social-media app (something like a weblog) that users can log-in, add post, edit/delete their posts, add comments on people's posts, react to posts (like/dislike). (this is just a 'front-end' implementation, and it is not a complete, production-ready app. I just intended to show my skills to create an app using 4 technologies: React, Redux, TS, MUI, and also some important packages/libraries)



## Technologies Used:
  - React (+ React-Router-DOM)
  - Redux
  - TypeScript
  - Material UI
